## Code of Conduct

We abide by the [Rust Code of Conduct][coc] and ask that you do as well.

[coc]: https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html

## Filing an Issue

Think you've found a bug? File an issue! To help us understand and reproduce the
issue, provide us with:

* A test case that can be used to reproduce the bug
* The steps to reproduce the bug with the test case
* The expected behavior
* The actual actual (buggy) behavior

## Looking to Start Contributing to `pancakes`?

* [Issues labeled "easy"](https://github.com/fitzgen/pancakes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aeasy)

## Building

```
$ cargo build
```

## Testing

```
$ cargo test
```

## Automatic code formatting

We use [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) to enforce a consistent code style across the whole
`pancakes` code base.

You can install the latest version of `rustfmt` with this command:

```
$ cargo install -f rustfmt-nightly
```

Ensure that `~/.cargo/bin` is on your path.

Once that is taken care of, you can (re)format all code by running this command:

```
$ cargo fmt
```

The code style is described in the `rustfmt.toml` file in top level of the repo.

## Pull Requests and Code Reviews

Ensure that each commit stands alone, and passes tests. This enables better `git
bisect`ing when needed. If your commits do not stand on their own, then rebase
them on top of the latest master and squash them into a single commit.

All pull requests undergo code review before merging.

Unsure who to ask for review? Ask any of:

* `@fitzgen`
* TODO: need more maintainers *hint hint*
